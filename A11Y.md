## 1. Perceivability

 - Each media including video and image contains an alt arritbute

## 2. Operability

  - At each page, we add extra buttons to allow admin/player navigate to other pages
  - At login/register page, we enable component to listen some keyboard event, for example when user enter all info to sign in, they can press enter instead of clicking login button
  - We add header menu at admin homepage, which allows admin to navigate to other webpage 

## 3. Undestandability

  - Besides what is mentioned in spec, Whenever necessary, there will be a popup (error or success) for admin. To indicate what they have done is failed or successful.

## 4. Robustness

  - In our application, we use meterial ui as our main framework. Most elements are from material ui, which perform specific roles in terms of their usage. 
  - When it comes to chart implementation, some of them are from rechart, an another react framework for building an nice looking chart.
